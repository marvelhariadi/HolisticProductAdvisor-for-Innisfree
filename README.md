# Holistic Skincare Routine Adviser for Innisfree

A web-hosted skincare routine maker for Korean Skincare & Beauty brand: Innisfree.

## Context

I created this when I was studying IB HL Computer Science when I was in high school. This project was created 2019-2020. I was thrust into project-building with almost 0 guidance and very little previous experience in coding other than basic if-statements and print.

Part of the IB Computer Science requirements is to create a project for a client of choice, complete with documentation (ie. our IA, "internal assessment"). This is my project for the IA.

## User Story

The project is a quick and user-friendly web application meant to be used in-store in Innisfree franchises. Customers can quickly answer the skincare questionnaire, inputting their skin type and current skincare concerns. The program will then output a full recommended skincare routine based on their response. The products outputted are tailored to meet the customer's specific skin type and skincare concerns.

## Technical information

The project is a web application. It is written in mostly php with some HTML and CSS for web design purposes. It uses mySQL in order to manage the database of skincare products. The product requires an active mySQL server.

## Documentation

The documentation that accompanies this project is formatted according to the IB HL Computer Science guidelines.

Components:

-   **Criterion A:** summary of the problem domain, and rationale for creating the solution (ie. the program) for the problem, success criteria

-   **Criterion B:** test plan to test the success criteria, planned schedule of tasks, database architecture and user-interface planning

-   **Criterion C:** developed database architecture and user-interface

-   **Criterion D:** final product video showcase

-   **Criterion E:** client feedback

-   **Appendix:** client interview transcript

## Final product video:

The Criteria D video was unable to be uploaded to GitHub due to the file size. It can be accessed via my Google Drive [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNYVVFBOOJw).
